  <p>This document describes a simple method of ruby composition 
  for Japanese layout realized with technologies like CSS, SVG, and XML-FO, 
  as information for rendering engine implementers. 
  Unlike 
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/"><abbr title="Requirements for Japanese Text Layout">JLReq</abbr></a>
  [[JLREQ]], only one layout method for each case is presented in this 
  document, with consideration of best practices and important points in 
  Japanese layout. 
  Points took in consideration are described in 
  <a href="#matters-considered-by-the-simple-placement-rules"></a>. 
  Also layout of the double-sided ruby, which has two distinct runs of 
  ruby text attached to the same ruby base character string, is added in 
  this document which is not described in [[JLREQ]].
  </p>

  <p>
  [[JLREQ]] in one part is a record of Japanese layout that has been 
  established in printing industry. It explains multiple ways for one thing, 
  and sometimes they can be very complex. Ruby is one such case. 
  There are so many factors to consider and often requirements contradict 
  each other (c.f. Note. "Protrusion of ruby from base characters").
  It is challenging to automate ruby because of the complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
  It would seem beneficial to come up with a method that is simple and robust, 
  and one that is suitable for automatic processing. The positioning might 
  not be as sophisticated but we must at least make sure that it causes no 
  misunderstanding.
  </p>

  <p>The following is a proposal for a simple processing system. The target audience is implementers and specification writers.
  It is expected that a full system may be more complex that what is described here,
  both due to the interaction with other features or other writing systems,
  and because those designing such system may wish to provide alternative options.
  Note that the terminology is based on that defined in [[JLREQ]].

<p>Ruby is the name given to the small annotations
in Japanese content that are rendered alongside base text,
usually to provide a pronunciation guide,
but sometimes to provide other information.
(See the article <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby.en">“What is ruby”</a>
by the internationalization Working Group
for more information.)

    <aside class=note title="Ruby as notes">
      Notes are sometimes placed between lines
      similarly to how ruby is laid out
      (inter-linear notes).
      The inter-linear notes is not covered in this document.
      Putting a line break within ruby string is not allowed for mono-ruby. 
      In addition, putting a line break within ruby base text is not allowed 
      for group-ruby. 
      In contrast, interlinear notes may have a large number of characters, 
      putting line breaks within both the base text and the note itself
      need to be allowed. It leads the processing of the inter-linear notes
      be different from ruby.

<h3 id="the-difficulties-of-ruby-processing">The Difficulties of Ruby Processing</h3>

<p>When performing ruby layout in Japanese,
the following factors need to be considered
in order to decide on the position:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to handle the correspondence between the base characters and the ruby</li>
  <li>What to do when the string of base characters is longer than the ruby string</li>
  <li>What to do when the string of base characters is shorter than the ruby string</li>
  <li>
    <p>When the ruby string protrudes from the base character string,
    whether it can be allowed to overhang on the characters preceding or following,
    and whether this affects the position of the base characters</p>
    <aside class=note title="Protrusion of ruby from base characters">
      From principle not to have extra spacing between characters in Japanese composition, 
      one method of layout is to overhang on the ruby string preceding or 
      following 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-15">Hiragana (cl-15)</a> [[JLREQ]] 
      characters but not to overhang on the ruby string preceding 
      or following Kanji characters. 
      This method works well when characters preceding and following 
      the ruby base are both Kana
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-15">Hiragana (cl-15)</a> [[JLREQ]] 
      or both Kanji. 
      It however can have an unbalanced look when one is 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-15">Hiragana (cl-15)</a> [[JLREQ]] 
      and the other is Kanji and if the ruby string is longer than the ruby base.
      (see <a href="#ruby-protruding-mono"></a> as mono-ruby case, 
      first example takes a rule to overhang on the ruby string preceding or
      following 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-15">Hiragana (cl-15)</a> [[JLREQ]] 
      characters but not to overhang on the ruby string preceding   
      or following Kanji characters.) 
      This is also the same for group-ruby 
      (see <a href="#ruby-protruding-group"></a>). 
      In letterpress printing, layout was adjusted with a situation of
      each case taken into account. Some publishers placed an additional 
      rule for ruby string in 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-26">Katakana (cl-16)</a> [[JLREQ]]
      not to overhang on the 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-26">Katakana (cl-16)</a> [[JLREQ]]
      ruby string any of preceding or following character, since ruby string in 
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-26">Katakana (cl-16)</a> [[JLREQ]]
      are considered as a unit. 
      For such case, a method not to overhang any ruby string could gain 
      layout with balanced appearance depends on size of the ruby string 
      (see <a href="#ruby-protruding-group-kana"></a>, second example takes 
      the method).

    <p>When there are multiple base characters,

</ol>

<p>In movable type typography,
such matters were resolved based generic principles,
and could always be corrected during the proofreading phase.
Essentially, each case was adjusted individually in a flexible manner.</p>

<p>In computer-based typesetting,
the layout needs to be more or less determined based on predetermined rules,
but it remained necessary to adjust the results in certain cases,
for example by changing the association between base characters
and the ruby string,
or by switching to a different placement policy.</p>

<p>When thinking about computing placement for web content,
it is not practical to decide on the positioning
case by case as was done in movable type typography.
It is therefore necessary to decide upon comprehensive rules
that provide solutions to all the problems listed above,
so that placement may be determined fully automatically.
Considering all the possibilities that existed in movable type typesetting,
the system to be designed needs to be very complex.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3 id="matters-considered-by-the-placement-rules">Matters considered by the placement rules</h3>

<p>Here are the fundamental assumptions underlying the simple placement rules.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ruby is used to display the reading or the meaning of the base characters.
    Therefore, the number one priority here is to avoid misreadings.
    Specifically, the ruby string which protrudes from the base character 
    string is not allowed to be overhung by the characters preceding or 
    following, whether it is a Kanji or Kana character. 

    <aside class=note title="Protruding over surrounding characters">
      The main placement method defined in JIS X 4051 [[JISX4051]]
      allows some amount of overhang over the preceding and following base characters,
      but recognizes the method defined here as an allowed variant.
    </aside>
  </li>
  <li>The method is agnostic to horizontal vs vertical writing,
    and will use the same logic in either case.
    Specifically, the center of the ruby string and of the base character 
    string are aligned in the inline direction for mono-ruby. 
    </li>
  <li>Two-step processing method is taken. 
    In the first step, processing of layout only considers about the ruby 
    string and the base character string (collectively call both of them as 
    the ruby block in this document), to decide relative position of the ruby 
    string and the ruby base character string. 
    In the second step, processing of layout decides a position of the ruby 
    base character string in a line, with consideration of preceding and 
    following characters.
    In other words, the relative position of the ruby string and the 
    ruby base character string decided in the first step is not modified 
    regarding of any preceding and following characters. 
    Also, this document does not take a method to align the first or last 
    character of the ruby base character string to the line head or the line 
    end, by modifying the relative position of the ruby string and the ruby 
    base character string when the ruby base character string is placed at 
    the line head or the line end. 
    Summarizing the above, resulting positionings by the first step are not 
    modified by the second step at all. 
    </li>
  <li>
    Although there are cases where multiple ways of positioning ruby are shown in [[JLREQ]] 
    and JIS X 4051 [[JISX4051]], this document only describes one method based on 
    the policies described above. 
    Also methods described in this document are mostly chosen from ones provided 
    in JIS X 4051 [[JISX4051]]. 
    In some cases, this document picks optional methods to be allowed as 
    implementation defined, such that protruding ruby string is not overhung on 
    any preceding and following Kana characters. 
    </li>
  <li>
    There is a demand to use larger (or smaller) font size for ruby string. 
    In this document, the default font size of ruby string is set to half of the 
    font size of ruby base character string, and examples in figures are 
    shown with the default font size. 
    Sizes of spacing adjustments during justification are defined based on 
    the font size of ruby base character string but not of ruby string, 
    and this makes methods of layout are applicable for cases whose font size 
    of ruby string is not a half of its ruby base character string. 
    </li>
</ol>

    <aside class=note title="Wrap opportunities">
      In computer-based typesetting,
      rather than always suppressing line wrap opportunities,
      they would be allowed in cases like compound words.
      This is because it may otherwise triggers very large
      spacing adjustments during justification.
    </aside>

<section>
<h3 id="types-of-ruby">Types of ruby</h3>

<p>Ruby in Japanese may be divided into the following 3 different types,
based on the relationship between the ruby and the base characters
(see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#usage_of_ruby">JLReq “3.3.1 Usage of Ruby”</a> [[JLREQ]]).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mono-ruby</li>
  <li>Jukugo-ruby</li>
  <li>Group-ruby</li>
</ol>

<figure id=ruby-types>
  <img src="img/fig04.svg" />
  <figcaption>Types of ruby</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Which one to use depends on the relationship
between the ruby and the base characters.
Mono-ruby is used to connect ruby to a single base character,
Jukugo-ruby is used when multiple base characters each have a corresponding ruby
and at the same time the whole group needs to be processed together,
and group-ruby is used when ruby is attached to a group of base characters together (see <a href="#ruby-types"></a>).
Each is used when specified.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="ruby-character-size-and-character-placement">Ruby character size and character placement</h3>

<p>The size of the ruby characters
and their placement in the inline direction relative to the base characters is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The size of the ruby is by default set to
    half of the size of the base characters.</li>
  <li>In vertical text, ruby is placed to the right of the base characters,
    and the character frame of the ruby is placed flush
    against the character frame of the base characters.

      <img src="img/fig05.svg" />
      <figcaption>Example of vertical ruby</figcaption>

    </figure>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following sections describe in detail the placement of
mono-ruby,
jukugo-ruby,
and group-ruby.
However, since jukugo-ruby is more complex,
it is explained last.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="placement-of-mono-ruby">Placement of mono-ruby</h3>

<p>Mono-ruby is placed as follows. 
To align following items to the two-step processing method described in 
<a href="#matters-considered-by-the-placement-rules"></a>, 
points 1, 2, and 3 are of the first step, and points 4 and 5 are of the second 
step. 
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When the ruby is made of two or more characters,
    each character in the ruby string is placed
    immediately next to its neighboring character,
    without any inter-letter spacing.
    Furthermore, when the ruby is composed of characters such as
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-24">Grouped numerals (cl-24)</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-25">Unit symbols (cl-25)</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a>,
    or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a> [[JLREQ]]
    which have their own individual width,
    they are placed based on each character’s metrics.
    <figure>
      <img src="img/fig07.svg" />
      <figcaption>Example mono-ruby with western characters</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
  </li>
  <li>The center of the ruby string and of the base character string
    are aligned in the inline direction.
    (see <a href="#mono-ex-1"></a>).</li>
  <li>Since the base character and its associated ruby form a single unit
    there is no line wrapping opportunity inside a mono-ruby.</li>
  <li>
    <p>When the ruby string is longer than the base character string,
    the part of the ruby string that extends beyond the base characters
    must not overhang on the characters preceding or following 
    (see <a href="#mono-ex-1"></a>).
    Spacing is introduced accordingly
    between these preceding or following characters and the base characters.
    <figure id=mono-ex-1>
      <img src="img/fig08.svg" />
      <figcaption>Example 1 of mono-ruby protruding</figcaption>
    </figure>

    However, in the following punctuation marks 
    like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-06">Full stops (cl-06)</a>
    [[JLREQ]]
    which have spacing before or after the symbols, 
    the ruby characters do overhang on the preceding or following characters
    (see <a href="#mono-ex-2"></a>).
    (Punctuation marks like 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-06">Full stops (cl-06)</a> 
    [[JLREQ]] play an important role as breaks between sentences, 
    it is desired to keep constant spacing for preceding or following of these 
    characters that having extra spacing around these characters could change 
    a meaning of breaks between sentences. 
    Also there is no issue like ones noted in note 
    "Protrusion of ruby from base characters". 
    Therefore, this method places a different layout on punctuation marks like 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-06">Full stops (cl-06)</a> 
    [[JLREQ]].
    )

    <ul>
      <li>If the character preceding the base character is one of:
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-02">Closing brackets (cl-02)</a>,
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-06">Full stops (cl-06)</a>,
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-07">Commas (cl-07)</a>,
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-14">Full-width ideographic space (cl-14)</a>,
        or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-05">Middle dots (cl-05)</a> [[JLREQ]],
        then the ruby must overhang on 
        the blank portion at the end the character.
        (This blank portion is usually half the character’s width,
        except in the case of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-05">Middle dots (cl-05)</a> [[JLREQ]]
        where it is a fourth of the character width).
        However, if this blank part has been compressed
        due to justification or similar processing of the line,
        then the ruby may only overhang on the resulting
        compressed blank spacing 
        (e.g. if it was reduced from half to a quarter em,
        hang at most a quarter em).</li>
      <li>If the character following the base character is one of:
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-01">Opening brackets (cl-01)</a> or

        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-05">Middle dots (cl-05)</a> [[JLREQ]],
        then the ruby must overhang on 
        the blank portion at the start the character.
        (This blank portion is usually
        half the character’s width for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-01">Opening brackets (cl-01)</a>,
        or a quarter of the character’s width for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-05">Middle dots (cl-05)</a> [[JLREQ]])
        However, if this blank part has been compressed

In this section, placement rules of group-ruby are described as combinations 
of two groups of characters, 
one as "Western characters" which has proportional width 
and consisted with characters like 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#cl-24">Grouped numerals (cl-24)</a>,

For Western characters, strings are read by clusters of multiple characters, 
it is desired to avoid adding spacing between characters for justification. 
The way they are positioned depends
on how their respective lengths would
compare if they were each laid out
without any inter-letter spacing.
When their respective lengths would be the same,
both are laid out without inter-letter spacing
and placed such that their respective centers in the inline direction are aligned
(see <a href="#group-ruby"></a>).
For other cases, the placement depends on the following:

<aside class=note title="Inter-letter spacing in group-ruby">
In the case of group-ruby, it is desired to align the length of ruby string 
and the length of ruby base character string, but these lengths could differ 
by numbers of characters. To compensate their difference, adding spacing 
to preceding, following, and inter-letter of ruby string or ruby base 
character string is used for "Japanese characters". 
Adding spacing by a ratio of 1 to preceding and following, and 2 to 
inter-letter was noted as a method to make well balanced layout in letterpress 
printing, and is used in following method. 
In contrast, for Western characters, this document focuses on keeping clusters of 
Western characters rather than alignment of lengths, and does not take 
a method to have inter-letter spacing.

<p>Jukugo-ruby is placed as follows:</p>
To align following items to the two-step processing method described in

</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With jukugo-ruby, each base character is associated with its own ruby string.
    When the length of each of these ruby string laid out without inter-letter spacing
    is shorter than the length of all their corresponding base characters,
    placement is determined as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When the ruby string associated with an individual base character is 1 character long,
        the ruby character and the base character
        are placed such that their respective centers in the inline direction are aligned
        (see <a href=#jukugo-1></a>).

      <li>When the ruby string associated with an individual base character is 2 characters long or more,
        the ruby string is laid out without inter-letter spacing,
        and placed such that its center and the center of its base character are aligned in the inline direction
        (see <a href=#jukugo-1></a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For simple ruby implementations,
	if even a single ruby string is longer than its corresponding base character
    when laid out without inter-letter spacing,
    the resulting layout would look identical to group-ruby
    (see <a href=#jukugo-2></a> and <a href=#jukugo-3></a>).

  </li>
  <li>With jukugo-ruby, individual base characters and their associated ruby string are treated as a unit,
    and line wrap opportunities are allowed between two base characters.
    When such a line wrap occurs,
    if a single base character that is part of the jukugo is placed alone at the end or at the start of a line,
    it is laid out identically to mono-ruby;
    conversely when several base characters that are part of the jukugo
    are placed together at the end or start of a line,
    they are laid out together as has been described in this section about jukugo-ruby

<section>
<h3 id="placement-of-double-sided-ruby-by-combination-of-type-of-ruby">Placement of Double-Sided Ruby by Combination of Type of Ruby</h3>
<p>
Quite complexed methods are required on full rules for placement of double-sided ruby 
composition. For simple placement of double-sided ruby, rules could be written per 
combinations of mono-ruby, group-ruby, and jukugo-ruby for two sides. 
As the same as the two-step processing, consideration of the ruby string that 
extended beyond the ruby base characters with preceding and following 
characters, and placement at the line head or the line end are processed as 
the same way as when the ruby string is used for one side. 
</p>

<aside class=note title="Space between adjacent lines and double-sided ruby">
When two adjacent rows has double-sided ruby, overlap of two ruby strings could happen 
for configuration of space between lines, which cases should be avoided. 
Following methods could be applied to avoid these cases:
<ol>
  <li>
    Configure space between lines over whole document in advance to avoid 
    overlap of two ruby strings. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Use wider line gap where overlap of two ruby strings happens to avoid 
    overlap. In some methods, a rule to have quarter em gap between two ruby 
    strings in addition to avoiding overlap was applied. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Place lines with double-sided rruby at regions for multiple lines, instead of 
    having wider line gaps. 
    For example, lines with double-sided ruby are set at the center of a two line 
    space ("center of two line space"). 
    (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#processing_of_gyoudori">JLReq "Processing of Gyou-dori"</a> [[JLREQ]])
  </li>
  <li>
    Use wider line gap to avoid overlap of two ruby strings over whole 
    paragraph but not the line gap where overlap of two ruby strings happens. 
  </li>
</ol>
In letterpress printing, first method was used for cases whose document has 
a large number of ruby or many reference marks of notes, second or third method 
was used for cases whose document has less ruby. 
In automatic processing used for the Web documents, third method might be 
suitable. Using third method with assigning integer number of line spaces 
(for example, center of two line space) makes disorder of line positioning 
to be limited to the line, and line positions aligned to next column.

In JIS X 4051 [[JISX4051]], first, second, and third cases in above list of 
combinations are ruled. 
(see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/#n104">note in JLReq</a> [[JLREQ]]) 
A rule of placement of the third case is to process continuous mono-ruby as 
group-ruby, and the same as the second case as a result. 
</p>
<p>
For the fourth case of mono-ruby and jukugo-ruby, the first case is applicable 
with dividing jukugo-ruby into continuous mono-ruby by picking individual pairs of Kanji character as ruby base character and ruby string.
For the fifth case of jukugo-ruby with group-ruby or jukugo-ruby, the second 
case is applicable with handling jukugo-ruby as group-ruby.
